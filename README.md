# employee-tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a program using node.js to allow the user to view, add, and update elements from a mysql database directed by a command line prompt. This program is linked to a database containing information for a company, including information on all departments, roles within these departments, and employees.

## Installation

Simply download the file from my github repo. You will then need to run the schema.sql file in mysql workbench followed by the seed.sql file to set up the initial database. After that, open the terminal for the folder that you copied from my repo. Once the terminal is open, type npm install. This will allow you to have all of the necessary packages to run my program (ie. Inquirer, console.table, and mysql2). 

## Usage

Open the terminal in this folder. Type node index.js to begin the prompt. Go through all of the questions for each section that you would like to add content for in the employee tracker database. Once complete you should have an been able to see all necessary information for each department, role, and employee. In addition, you will have had the chance to add and update different tables in the database. 

If you have other Questions you can refer to the video or refer to my GitHub profile.

This is the video running the program. If the gif doesnt look clear, try the first link and download. I would recommend following the link and downloading anyway, since it comes out much more clear.
